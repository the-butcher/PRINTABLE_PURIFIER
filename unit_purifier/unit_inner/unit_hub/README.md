| Description | The lower part of the impeller hub. |
| Postprocessing | Remove the supports. Smoothen air outlet a bit to improve air flow and reduce noise. |
| Improvements | Create supports that are easier to remove, especially for the motor opening. Maybe make the motor opening a little larger, i had to do some sanding in my build before the motor could be fitted. |
| Type | 3D print |
