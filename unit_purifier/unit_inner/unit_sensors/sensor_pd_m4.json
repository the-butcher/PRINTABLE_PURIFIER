    "description": "The dust sensor is the input to the purifiers power level, together with the potentiometer setting. I used a sensor that i already had: ![PD-M4](https://github.com/the-butcher/PRINTABLE_PURIFIER/blob/master/unit_purifier/unit_inner/unit_sensors/sensor_pd_m4.png?raw=true) [PM-D4](http://www.csfan.co.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=products1&wr_id=15&ckattempt=2). This sensor appears not to be available in retail, therefore another sensor may have to be used, thus requiring changes to the sensor plate and to the sensor housing parts!",
