| Description | This part is used to connect the impeller parts and to fix the impeller to the 3.2mm axle of the motor. In my build i made the part from a leftover piece of 30mm POM  |
| Postprocessing | Cut a M10x1 thread on the 10mm end of the part, use a M10x1 nut for connecting the impeller parts. Have a 3mm hole in the part for a firm fit when pushing the part onto the motor axle. |
