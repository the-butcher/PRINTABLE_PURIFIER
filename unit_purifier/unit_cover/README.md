## Impeller cover (print_cover_1) &rarr; [STL File](https://github.com/the-butcher/PRINTABLE_PURIFIER/blob/master/unit_purifier/unit_cover/print_cover_1.stl)

| Description | This is the cover plate protecting both your fingers and the impeller. |
| Improvements | In my build there was not enough space to let the cover slide in, so i had to file down ca. 1mm. I would suggest printing this part after completing the purifier head, so you already know how much space remains to fit it in. |
| Type | 3D print |
