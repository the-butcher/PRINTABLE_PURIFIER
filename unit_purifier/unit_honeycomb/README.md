## Lower case (print_honeycomb_1) &rarr; [STL File](https://github.com/the-butcher/PRINTABLE_PURIFIER/blob/master/unit_purifier/unit_honeycomb/print_honeycomb_1.stl)

|   |   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Description | The lower border of the purifier case. |
| Postprocessing | Remove supports. Carefully widen the 1mm holes as printed to 2mm first, then to 3mm. File and sand the upper hexagon border so it properly fits the upper case part. I used rough sand paper wrapped around an allen key to file multiple hexagon side at once. |
