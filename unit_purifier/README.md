## ## [unit_head](https://github.com/the-butcher/PRINTABLE_PURIFIER/tree/master/unit_purifier/unit_head)

|   |   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Description | Head |
| Postprocessing | Glue print_outer_ring to print_outer_controls, sand the combined part after glue has dried to remove glue remains, spray paint for a better finish. |
| Improvements | When sliding the head over the hub, it does not auto center on the hub. This can lead to not enough space between the impeller and the head. I inserted 6 strips cut from a plastic bottle between head and hub for even spacing. |
