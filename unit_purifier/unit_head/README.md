# Head (unit_head)

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The purifiers head with display and simple controls.  |
| Postprocessing | Glue "Lower head" to "Upper head", sand the combined part after glue has dried to remove glue remains, spray paint for a better finish. |
| Improvements | When sliding the head over the hub, it does not auto center on the hub. This can lead to not enough space between the impeller and the head. I inserted 6 strips cut from a plastic bottle between head and hub for even spacing. |

## Head connector (print_outer_connect) &rarr; [STL File](https://github.com/the-butcher/PRINTABLE_PURIFIER/blob/master/unit_purifier/unit_head/print_outer_connect.stl)

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Description | This part connects the outer and inner parts of the head.  |
| Postprocessing | With a 3mm drill widen the 12 holes. This will make it easier to insert the M3 screws when assembling the purifier. |
| Type | 3D print |

## Lower head (print_outer_controls) &rarr; [STL File](https://github.com/the-butcher/PRINTABLE_PURIFIER/blob/master/unit_purifier/unit_head/print_outer_controls.stl)

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The lower part of the outfacing head. This part holds the OLED display and the potentiometer that controls the power setting.  |
| Postprocessing | User pliers to remove supports. Clean up openings for display and potentiometer so these fit properly. |
| Improvements | In my build the pins on the outside of the OLED display were portruding too far to fit the display. I had to file away some material from the display opening. |
| Type | 3D print |

## Inner head (print_outer_outlet) &rarr; [STL File](https://github.com/the-butcher/PRINTABLE_PURIFIER/blob/master/unit_purifier/unit_head/print_outer_outlet.stl)

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The infacing part of the head.  |
| Postprocessing | Use a 4mm drill to open the screwholes. Use a 4mm screw to pull M4 nuts into the respective openings. The nuts should have a tight fit and not come out, once seated.
Sand and spray for a better finish. |
