# PRINTABLE PURIFIER ASSEMBLY

### 1) Hub and Impeller 1
![Step 1](./assembly_1a.png)

This is the most critical step, so let's get it done first to be able to adapt to it later. Be sure the z-axis of your printer is perpendicular to the bed, or your impeller will get a bad wobble.

Print [Lower hub](../unit_purifier/unit_inner/unit_hub/print_hub_1.stl) and [Lower impeller](../unit_purifier/unit_impeller/print_impeller_1.stl) first and make the [Impeller mount](../unit_purifier/unit_inner/unit_motor/lathe_motor_connect.stl) or have it made. Get a 555-1 type motor and have two flat M3 screws ready.

The impeller may have require balancing initially. I build a very simple balancing utility to find the heavier side of the impeller, but you could also just mount the impeller on a 10mm rod, then put both ends of the rod on equal height and horizontal surfaces. The impeller would then roll back and forth to find its balance. Another way is balancing by trial and error while mounted.

Insert counterweights into the provided 6mm holes as required until vibration is tolerable when the impeller is spinning in the hub. I used 6mm brass rod pieces as counterweights.

### 2) Hub and Impeller 2

Print [Upper hub](../unit_purifier/unit_inner/unit_hub/print_hub_2.stl) and [Upper impeller](../unit_purifier/unit_impeller/print_impeller_2.stl). Have M4 screws and 20MM M4 nuts ready. Repeat balancing with the upper impeller. I got the 20mm long M4 nuts in electronics supply rather than in a hardware store.

### 3) Inners

Build all remaining units described in [Inners](../unit_purifier/unit_inner).
